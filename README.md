## Goal: 
there are many good movies which are not well known to the public. I created an
extract of the best movies from IMDB using Python.
## Solution: 
the Python script reads films from the IMDB database from 2000 to 2022 with
a metascore of over 60.
## Result: 
It generates a table and writes it to a XLSX file in descending order of rating.
Future: future plans include creating a web site using Django.
